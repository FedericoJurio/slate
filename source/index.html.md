## Making requests
As per RESTful design patterns, Monrovia API implements following HTTP verbs

Code | Description
---- | -----------
GET | Read resources
POST | Create new resources
PUT | Modify existing resources
DELETE | Remove resources

When making requests, arguments can be passed as params, form data or JSON with correct Content-Type header.

## CORS
Monrovia API supports cross-origin HTTP requests which is commonly referred as [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). This means that you can call API resources using Javascript from any browser. While this allows many interesting use cases, itâ€™s important to remember that you should never expose private API keys to 3rd parties.

# Authentication

Monrovia uses API keys to allow access to the API.

## Generate access token

To authenticate a user you must provide the API credentials in the Authorization header and the user credentials in the payload. If the request succeed, the API will provide a Bearer token that expects to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
